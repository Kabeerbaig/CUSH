BUILT IN COMMANDS
    
    jobs    
    fg
    bg 
    kill
    exit
    stop

    should use consecutively numbered small integers to enumerate jobs 

    Commands implemented by the shell itself
        1)  check if the input is one of the these commands


NON BUILT IN COMMANDS

    External commands that need to be forked and executed
        1) Fork a new child process
        2) execute the program in the context of a child

        Background Job
            if user appends a '&' to a command, the command is started and the shell will 
            return back to the prompt
        Foreground Job
            shell will wait for a command to complete before reading the next command


JOB CONTROL

    user may interrupt foreground jobs
    send foreground jobs into the background 

    at a given moment
        shell may run zero or more background jobs and zero or more foreground jobs

    if foreground job
        shell waits for ti complete before printing another prompt and reading

    shell will inform the user about status changes of the jobs it manages
        jobs may exit, terminate due to a signal, or be stopped for several reasons





Handling SIGCHILD to Process Status changes

    shell will receive a SIGCHILD to notify it on the status of a job asynchronously

    need to catch SIGCHILD signal to learn when the shell's child processes change status

    shell should not assume that a status change has occured until receives information from OS
